# Open - Unleashing boundless potential through global collaboration

Welcome to the Open GitHub organization!

Open is a community-driven, global collaboration platform that facilitates the submission and development of ideas using open-source principles and a fair licensing system for assigning ownership based on individual contributions. Our goal is to solve the problem of wasted talent by creating a more efficient and effective way to innovate and create new products and services through multi-tiered collaboration on a global scale.

Our platform is built on open-source principles, which means that anyone can submit and work together on their ideas to bring them to fruition. We encourage contributions from all developers, regardless of experience level, as we believe that diversity and inclusivity are essential to driving innovation.

On our GitHub organization, you can find the open-source code for our platform and contribute to our projects. To start contributing, please take a look at our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We welcome and appreciate any contributions, whether it's in the form of code, documentation, bug reports, or feature requests. Together, we can create something truly impactful.

Thank you for your interest in Open, we are excited to see what you will bring to the table!
